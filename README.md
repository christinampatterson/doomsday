# Doomsday

Sick of forgetting about an important project? Do assignments and classes feel less tangible because of remote learning? Doomsday eliminates the stress associated with time management by doing the hard part for you. In reflecting on our own schedules as full time MIT students, we all agreed that looking at our calendars filled with every assignment, meeting, and lecture was anxiety-inducing. With so many tasks in front of you it is tempting to procrastinate. Doomsday points you to bite size pieces of your work, allowing you to approach your work little by little, avoiding the panic of the due date.

Key features of Doomsday include: simple, aesthetic graphics that show you only the most important information and timeline bars to ensure visual clarity and help the user to prioritize near approaching assignments. With our streamlined design, we avoid the unnecessary stress of calendars filled with events of all kinds. The user has the ability to customize and install multiple deadlines for complex projects and papers.

The name Doomsday is dramatic so your deadlines don't have to be. In a few easy steps, Doomsday helps you from stressed to rested.
